export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hello! I'm a computer science engineer from the vibrant city of Chennai, transforming technical skills into innovative solutions. 
My toolbox? ReactJs, NodeJs, Django, Blender, and a sprinkle of creativity. Whether creating seamless experiences with a chat app or building a Todo App powered by MongoDB, I thrive on challenges and the satisfaction of overcoming them.
ðŸ’¡ Breaking barriers with bytes. From coding apps to crafting games, I thrive on turning ideas into reality, making an impact one project at a time.
My academic foundation, cemented at VIT Vellore, equipped me with a deep understanding of computer science principles, which I've applied across varied projects â€“ from a weather app that keeps you prepared to game development that entertains. I don't just code; I create experiences. As a former Risk Analyst Intern at UBS, I honed my analytical skills, ensuring financial stability through tech solutions. If you're intrigued by the fusion of technology and creativity or have a project in mind that challenges the norm, I'm all ears. Together, let's craft the extraordinary! ðŸŒŸ`;
